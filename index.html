            <p>Hi my name is <strong>jared carle</strong>. I've been designing and
            taking photos for about 3 years now and am very 
            excited to get into the <em>web developing</em> side of the 
            field of media. I am a reservist with the <em>Canadian 
            army</em> and I also work for a <em>Media & Strategy agency</em>.
            I played competitive hockey until i joined the 
            army as sadly it took up too much. I like to spend 
            my time either outdoors with my buddies or at my desk 
            playing computer games. <em>Web development</em> has always
            been something i wanted to do and now i am very 
            excited to start.
            </p>
