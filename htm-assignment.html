<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi my name is <strong>jared carle</strong>. I've been designing and
     taking photos for about 3 years now and am very 
     excited to get into the <em>web developing</em> side of the 
     field of media. I am a reservist with the <em>Canadian 
     army</em> and I also work for a <em>Media & Strategy agency</em>.
     I played competitive hockey until i joined the 
     army as sadly it took up too much. I like to spend 
     my time either outdoors with my buddies or at my desk 
     playing computer games. <em>Web development</em> has always
     been something i wanted to do and now i am very 
     excited to start.
